As Ted and his newly assembled comradeship walked out of the grotto, they were met with the cheers of a still growing crowd. With the well wishes of the tribe ringing in their ears, they set off. The forest was vast and they were looking at days of wandering before they could survey the outer edges. With Gavin leading them with his map, they would be able to reach the edge of the forest through the shortest path. Prio followed close behind Gavin up in the crowns of the trees, while Ted was walking below. He was quickly losing ground. Ted was still getting used to his new gorilla-like body and didn't dare attempt crawling up the tall trees. Masquerading as Bamm the ape, he also had no wings therefore lacking the soaring monkeys ability to glide between great distances. Behind Ted were the battle twins Gab and Gib who made up the rearguard and were soaring high up between the trees. The brothers were still tied together with the Rope ["A Vendible Horrid Knish"] and elegantly avoided getting it stuck on anything between them, without stopping, as they travelled in flawless coordination.

Shortly after leaving the sight of civilization behind and letting the thicks of the forest swallow the group, one of the brothers, Gab, the one with the [Shield of Deflection] sprinted past Ted and towards the front. The rope would magically stretch and adjusted its length without strain.

Gab called out to Gavin. "Rest! Gavin! Reeest!" Gavin and Prio turned around and stopped to meet him. "Yes? Gab, what is it? We have no time for idle chatter." Gavin responded. Once Gab reached them they had a short chat before they all turned and glanced at Ted who was catching up at the bottom of the forest.

Their sharp glares shot from the crowns down at Ted, but before he could ready himself to confront them, a figure jumped out from above. In front of him was Gib with his [Dagger of Immobilization] unsheathed. Gib shoved Ted against a tree trunk, ready to slit his throat. He loudly threatened Ted "Bamm! You may have fought valiantly against a golem and Shirley believes in your ability to fully recover. No one wants to see you plunging to the ground, while trying to jump between trees in your condition, however.." The dagger inched closer to Ted's throat. "Seeing you strolling around on your backfeet makes me think you are taking advantage of our leniency."

Speechless, Ted looked inwards struggling to find the words. He understood he was lacking behind, but felt there was more to this aggressive confrontation. He carefully nodded and in return Gib lowered the dagger and let him go, but after a few steps, just as Ted breathed a sigh of relief, Gib yelled out from behind him.

"Don't you dare mock us!"

With the dagger above his head, Gib charged at Ted. Only being able to turn around to see Gib's terrifying approach, Ted froze up. Just as the dagger shot forth and towered over him with an approach to gouge out one of Ted's eyes, the dagger disappeared. All of Gib's scars mirrored and he was carrying a shield. It wasn't Gib anymore, it was Gab standing infront of Ted. Gab shoved Ted to the ground and put his attention to Gib, who were with the rest of the group, watching the spectacle from amidst the treetops.

"Brother! I couldn't agree with you more, but a cut with that dagger will immobilize Bamm and we have barely left the village." Gab turned his attention to Ted "Once we are further from the village we won't be this tolerant." Ted rose from the ground, but before he could stand up, Gab pushed him down again and held his hand ready hovering above Ted's spine "By the time we reach the edge, you better have learned to run on your knuckles!"

As Ted stood hunched over with his arms outstretched to the ground, he felt Gab's touch on his back and froze up. Sweat broke out all over his body - not from exertion or the heat - and Ted was gasping for air. His excessive sweating could be felt down to the palm of his hands. He brought up one hand and looked desperately at his palm, clenched his hand into a fist and brought it back down. He repeated this with his other hand resulting in him standing on his knuckles and he carefully began moving forward at a crawl.

"That's it, now pick up the pace!" said Gab with a condescending tone "You won't be able to find your way out of this jungle alone, not without climbing the trees. So keep up and don't get lost!"

The vegetation had no varitey, it was an environment where only a few plants could survive, everything looked the same from the ground. An organic labyrinth. The group went back in formation and continued their journey. Ted dashed on all fours to keep up and would repeatedly bump into the trees. Being on all fours, he had a hard time keeping track of them in the crowns and mostly navigated by following the flow of falling leaves and the rustling of branches left behind by Gavin and Prio jumping across tree crowns. He kept up with the group and they travelled until late afternoon before they made camp.

Gavin instructed the group: Prio was to gather leaves and build beds in the crowns of the trees, Gib and Gab gathered dry wood for a fire, and Ted was told to find hard rocks and build the pit for the fire. Once everyone were done with their task, the group gathered around the unlit fireplace. Gavin gave each member what looked like an ordinary pinecone and flint & steel.

"You all know the drill, but I'll remind you all, just so Bamm doesn't screw this up." Gavin instructed with a resentful leer towards Ted. "If you sense any danger, confirm it. Then light this tinder with the flint and steel and throw it into the firepit." Gavin turned to face Ted directly and finished his instructions "Confirm before you light the firepit.. if anyone raises a false alarm, they will lose a finger. Alright?"

Prio was shaken by the instructions and almost dropped her pinecone.

"Yeah, we get it, Gavin! Hahahaa" Gib chuckled "Bamm is a broken mess, but he can't have forgotten how you cherish your sleep."

"Sleep tight everyone. Bamm, you be the lookout." Gab grinned "I'll take over once you climb up and wake me."

Gavin, Gib and Gab broke out in hysterical laughter. They felt certain they would be able to sleep all night long. Prio's cheeks puffed up, looking upset at their antics and a little worried for the night.

She spoke softly to Gavin "How is Bamm supposed to be the lookout from down on the ground?" Gavin turned to her and put his hand on her shoulder as if to reassure her: "We are still deep inside the forest. He will learn before the nights get dangerous."

At night, the moonlight covered the exposed surfaces with a soft blue gleam and barely reached Ted at the bottom of the forest. His hands and feet were covered in blisters from his failed attempts at climbing the trees. He wasn't able to reach a single branch and had repeatedly slid down from the trunk. He had given up and found himself sitting down and leaning against a tree trunk.

He would have to sleep in the dark, on the humid forest flooring. It wasn't ideal, but Ted became content with the thought of it, as he finally got to reflect on the many horrible events that had occurred since he was pulled out of his apartment. He had been in danger ever since. He had cheated death, been enslaved and fought for his life in three different bodies.

*Gulp*

Ted's hands rose to cover his mouth, he felt sick. My body.. I am gone. Ted's mind had been too occupied with surviving until recently and it now dawned upon Ted: His body had been devoured by rats and he wouldn't ever be able to be himself again. His face, his whole identity, was no more. A scene emerged in Ted's head. It was a gorilla, at a dinner table, in his parent's house. It was Ted, surrounded by his family. His brothers and sisters screamed in panic, his mother cried and his father stood ready to fight and protect his family.

"Why am I not shedding a single tear?" Ted gaspingly spoke to himself "I want to cry... I feel burned out" Despite his mental exhaustion and being at the edge of a mental breakdown, he felt hollow and only bore a gloomy expression.

Ted opened his status panel and read through the notifications. With time on his side, he was finally able to catch up and deeply investigate the panels.

One notification was about the Quest [Deeprooted Conflict], that he received after the first attack from the soaring monkeys. He tapped it and a process began.

You gain levels through completing quests, it seems. Ted was thrilled to gain more leeway when choosing his Skills, but, without breaking a smile, he remained frowning.

Ted went through his status effects. [Bamm's Aping of the Monkeys] remained the same, but things had changed in [Curse of the Scorned], his fragmented soul essence had gained new hosts.

His soul essence had been divided between three Plague Rats, when he was eaten alive, but now 2% of his soul was instead held by a being called "Plague Ratkin". Do the rats eat each other as well? The name change must mean they are mutating and possibly gaining sentience. Ted remembered the advertising on the website for the game; it was advertising evolving enemies that, if not stopped, would grow stronger, terrorizing their vicinities, and eventually expand their territory. How am I supposed to overcome a horde, that is growing this rapidly..

At least the curse itself has not changed or gotten worse. Now that Ted was alone and relaxed, he could better assess the situation. Could this curse make everyone hate me.. won't that impede on the concept of free will. Ted knew the curse reducing his charisma had to affect him somewhat, but he was uncertain to what degree. The world seemed cruel from the moment he became rat fodder. He doubted Petramus would treat a golem as a friend and the soaring monkeys clearly have a very primitive culture. As a game it would make more sense for charisma only to have an effect in certain situations, like trading with a vendor or dealing with a stat check. It could just mean girls will be significantly more likely to reject me.

There was no end in sight for these speculations, so Ted turned towards learning what [Peacebringer's Tranquil Mind] did. A status effect he has had since he arrived in the world.

Upon reading its description, Ted was overcome with a strong, stinging pain in his chest. A stream of emotions overwhelmed him. Sorrow, anger, and anguish shuffled around in his mind. He longed for the embrace of his family, but it was walled off. Feeling scared and unsafe, he sought to crawl back into his cozy, soft cotton bed left behind in his apartment, but the thought disappeared like a shooting star and Ted grew content with the hard trunk at his back and the wet wilds surrounding him. He felt at home.

Clutching the pinecone given to him by Gavin, Ted felt at ease and dozed off.

*Thump! Creak crackle*

Ted woke up to sudden sounds, panic morphing into confusion and back again as he looked down at what was in his hands. The pinecone. Ted looked for the firepit and raised his arm as to throw the pinecone. Forgetting to light it first, he threw it into the pit.

"Shit!" Ted had screwed up. He ran into the pit and shuffled through the wood in a frantic attempt at retrieving the pinecone, but to no avail.

Sparks appeared behind him and a soft red glow lit his surroundings. Ted turned around and was met with a friendly face.

"Shhh.." It was Prio, she had lit her pinecone. Softspoken, she approached Ted "Hey.. I know who you are."
