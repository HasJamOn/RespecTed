│  not making it into a vessel. Soul Essence may be lost   │

│  Shoots a beam out of the palm of your main-hand,        │
│  tranquilizing the target's Soul Essence in preparation  │
│  for a Soul Transfer. The user's Soul Essence will       │

│  cannot detect if the target hit is a proper vessel,     │
